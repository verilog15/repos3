    Middleware features:

    * The static large object (SLO) middleware now supports including
      a ``?part-number=<N>`` query parameter to request just part of a
      large object. This may be used to enable efficient parallel
      downloads. For more information, see `the documentation
      <https://docs.openstack.org/swift/latest/overview_large_objects.html#retrieving-a-large-object>`__.

    * The S3 API middleware now supports the ``?partNumber=<N>`` query
      parameter, enabling parallel downloads.

    * The KMS keymaster now supports overriding the endpoint returned
      in the Keystone catalog via the ``barbican_endpoint`` configuration
      option. This may be useful in multi-region deployments which have
      multiple endpoints.

    * The backend ratelimiter now supports dynamic reloading of limits.
      The new configuration options ``backend_ratelimit_conf_path`` and
      ``config_reload_interval`` control which file is reloaded and how
      frequently, respectively.

    * The backend ratelimiter now supports per-method, per-device
      ratelimits. See `etc/backend-ratelimit.conf-sample
      <https://github.com/openstack/swift/blob/master/etc/backend-ratelimit.conf-sample>`__
      for more information.

    * The account quota middleware now supports object-count quotas
      in addition to byte-count quotas, similar to the container
      quota middleware. For more information, see `the documentation
      <https://docs.openstack.org/swift/latest/middleware.html#module-swift.common.middleware.account_quotas>`__.

    Object expiration improvements:

    * Added per-account and per-container reaping delays. These may be
      used to offer some grace period in which to recover expired objects.

    * Added a proxy-server configuration option: ``allow_open_expired``.
      This defaults to false; if true, clients may intereact with expired
      objects by including an ``X-Open-Expired: true`` header in GET, HEAD,
      or POST requests.

    * Expiring object queue entries now include the size of the object to
      be expired in the ``swift_expirer_bytes`` parameter of the queue entry's
      content-type.

    * Added metrics to count skipped, delayed, and assigned tasks as
      they're enumerated.

    S3 API error response reasons are now logged as part of the ``log_info``
    field. This can be especially useful when diagnosing HEAD
    failures, which necessarily have no response body.

  - |
    Python 3.12 is now supported.

  - |
    ``swift-account-info`` now supports the ``--sync`` option to display the
    contents of the incoming and outgoing sync tables, similar to
    ``swift-container-info``.

  - |
    The ``swift-drive-audit`` tool now works with ISO timestamps in kernel
    logs.

upgrade:
  - |
    Dependency update: lxml must be at least 4.2.3.

deprecations:
  - |
    Overall account byte quotas should now be set with the
    ``X-Account-Quota-Bytes`` header. The ``X-Account-Meta-Quota-Bytes``
    header is now deprecated.

fixes:
  - |
    S3 API fixes:

    * Fixed a server error when using non-ASCII access key IDs.

    * Fixed several checksum-related error responses to be more AWS-like.

  - |
    Using an ``X-Remove-Account-Quota-Bytes-Policy-<policy name>`` header
    now removes the per-policy quota, rather than reducing it to zero.

  - |
    Proxy-server fixes:

    * Object POSTs now 503 rather than trusting the 404s that might be
      returned from handoffs when primaries are overloaded.

    * Client disconnects should always be logged within the context of
      the appropriate client request. Previously, there were some cases
      where logging would occur during general garbage collection, leading
      to incorrect or missing transaction IDs in logs.

    * The proxy-logging middleware now emits timing and transfer stats for
      more requests such as auth requests. These will be labeled ``UNKNOWN``
      rather than ``account``, ``container``, etc.

    * Fixed a server error when the Swift request path has missing account
      or container components.

    ``EUCLEAN`` errors are better handled on the object server.

  - |
    The ``swift-recon-cron`` tool now better handles missing directories.

    Various other minor bug fixes and improvements.
