8-mgmt-tools README
===================

This 8th stage installs management tools to Administer and Monitor the server -- and for Assessing its use and effectiveness.

As in the case of 6-generic-apps, 7-edu-apps and 9-local-addons: this stage installs user-facing (or operator-facing, in this case) server apps.
