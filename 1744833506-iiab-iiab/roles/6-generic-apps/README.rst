6-generic-apps README
=====================

This 6th stage is for server apps of a more generic, personal or collaborative nature -- as opposed to larger educational or LMS apps (Learning Management Systems) in 7-edu-apps.

Chat, Wiki, blogging and CMS's (Content Management Systems) can go here.

As in the case of 7-edu-apps, 8-mgmt-tools and 9-local-addons: this stage installs user-facing server apps.
