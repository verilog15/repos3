  "Identifier": "CVE-2024-6867",
  "PackageSlug": "npm/lunary",
  "Title": "Lunary information disclosure vulnerability",
  "Description": "An information disclosure vulnerability exists in the lunary-ai/lunary, specifically in the `runs/{run_id}/related` endpoint. This endpoint does not verify that the user has the necessary access rights to the run(s) they are accessing. As a result, it returns not only the specified run but also all runs that have the `run_id` listed as their parent run. This issue affects the main branch, commit a761d833. The vulnerability allows unauthorized users to obtain information about non-public runs and their related runs, given the `run_id` of a public or non-public run.",
