# Cleanlab

This package implements Cleanlab's [trustworthiness score](https://cleanlab.ai/tlm/) via API.


Trustworthiness scores help reduce hallucinations and enable reliable deployment of LLMs - learn more in [Overcoming Hallucinations with the Trustworthy Language Model](https://cleanlab.ai/blog/trustworthy-language-model/).

## Development Setup

Install `cleanlab-studio` to use Cleanlab's trustworthiness score:

```
pip install cleanlab-studio
```

Then, you can get an API key for free by [creating a Cleanlab account](https://app.cleanlab.ai/?signup_origin=TLM) or experiment with TLM in the [playground](https://tlm.cleanlab.ai/). You can also [email Cleanlab](mailto:sales@cleanlab.ai) for any special requests or support.

Lastly, set the `CLEANLAB_API_KEY` environment variable with the API key.
