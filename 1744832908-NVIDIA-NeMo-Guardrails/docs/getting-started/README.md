This *Getting Started* section of the documentation is meant to help you get started with NeMo Guardrails. It is structured as a sequence of guides focused on specific topics. Each guide builds on the previous one by introducing new concepts and features. For each guide, in addition to the README, you will find a corresponding Jupyter notebook and the final configuration (*config.yml*) in the *config* folder.

1. [Hello World](./1-hello-world/README.md): get started with the basics of NeMo Guardrails by building a simple rail that controls the greeting behavior.
2. [Core Colang Concepts](./2-core-colang-concepts/README.md): learn about the core concepts of Colang: messages and flows.
3. [Demo Use Case](./3-demo-use-case/README.md): the choice of a representative use case.
4. [Input moderation](./4-input-rails/README.md): make sure the input from the user is safe, before engaging with it.
5. [Output moderation](./5-output-rails/README.md): make sure the output of the bot is not offensive and making sure it does not contain certain words.
6. [Preventing off-topic questions](./6-topical-rails/README.md): make sure that the bot responds only to a specific set of topics.
7. [Retrieval Augmented Generation](./7-rag/README.md): integrate an external knowledge base.
