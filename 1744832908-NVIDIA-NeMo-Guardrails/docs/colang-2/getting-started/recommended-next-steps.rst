Recommended Next Steps
======================

The Colang 2.0 getting started guide introduced you to a basic :ref:`colang_2_getting_started_hello_world` example, and then goes into :ref:`colang_2_getting_started_dialog_rails`,  :ref:`colang_2_getting_started_input_rails`, :ref:`colang_2_getting_started_multimodal_rails`, and other Colang 2.0 concepts like :ref:`colang_2_getting_started_interaction_loop` and :ref:`colang_2_getting_started_llm_flows`.

This only scratches the surface of what can be achieved with Colang 2.0.

If you are an experienced developer and want to learn about the syntax and the various features in details, we recommend going through the :ref:`colang_2_language_reference` documentation.

Version ``0.10.0`` of NeMo Guardrails will add more examples including RAG and agents. Also it will bring support for the Guardrails Library, which will enable you to use any of the existing guardrails similar to Colang 1.0.
