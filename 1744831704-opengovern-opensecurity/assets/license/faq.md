## 1. Licensing

### How is opensecurity licensed?

opensecurity is licensed under version 1.1 of the Business Source License (BSL), a source-available license that allows copying, modification, redistribution, non-commercial use, and commercial use under certain conditions. This enables our community to use our source code for a wide range of purposes while preventing commercially competitive use of opensecurity’s paid version of the Licensed Work.

### What’s the difference between the BSL and other licenses (AGPL, SSPL, Common Clause)?

The Business Source License (BSL) used by Open Governance is designed to balance open-source principles with the needs of a commercial software company. Here's how it compares to other licenses:

**BSL**: This license is highly permissive, allowing **You** to freely use, modify, and redistribute the software. Think of it as a "trial period" for open source. Here's why:

- **Time-Limited**: The BSL has a specific duration. For opensecurity, this duration is the later of:
  - Four years after November 1, 2024: This provides a fixed date for the transition.
  - The fourth anniversary of the first public distribution of a specific version: This ensures that each version of the software has its own 4-year BSL period.
  
  After this period, the software automatically converts to the open-source Mozilla Public License 2.0 (MPL 2.0). This means that after the defined period, anyone can use, modify, and distribute the software without restriction.
  
- **Flexibility**: Before the BSL period expires, it provides Open Governance with the ability to generate revenue and invest in further development.

### Can I relicense my modified version of BSL-licensed software under a different license?
No. **Your** modified version is a derivative work that includes the original BSL-licensed code. The BSL does not allow you to relicense the original code under a different license. You can choose a different license for your modifications, but the original code remains under the BSL.

## 2. Competitive Offerings

### What is a "competitive offering"?

A "competitive offering" is any product or service sold to third parties that competes directly with opensecurity's paid version. This includes:

- **Similar Functionality**: Offering a product or service that performs the same or substantially similar functions as opensecurity's paid version.
- **Indirect Competition**: Hosting or embedding opensecurity's product in a solution that competes with opensecurity's commercial edition.

Products or services that are not sold or supported on a paid basis are generally not considered competitive.

If you have any questions about whether a specific use case falls under the definition of a "competitive offering," please contact opensecurity's licensing team at [licensing@opensecurity.io](mailto:licensing@opensecurity.io). Custom licensing terms may be available to enable use cases that are not covered by the standard BSL license.

### What is a "paid support arrangement"?

A "paid support arrangement" is any situation where you charge for assistance with the Licensed Work, regardless of whether the Licensed Work is embedded in another product or offered as a standalone service. This includes:

- **Direct Support Fees**: Charging directly for help with using, installing, or troubleshooting the Licensed Work.
- **Bundled Support**: Offering the Licensed Work for free but including support as a paid component of a larger service package.

Essentially, if you receive any form of payment for providing support related to the Licensed Work, it is considered a "paid support arrangement."

### What does "embedded" mean?

"Embedded" means incorporating opensecurity's code into a competing product in a way that makes opensecurity essential to its operation. This includes:

- **Direct Inclusion**: Adding opensecurity's source code or executable code (including libraries and frameworks) into your product.
- **Indirect Dependence**: Designing your product so that it needs to access or download opensecurity to function.

**Examples of embedding**:

- Offering a compliance service that uses opensecurity's software as part of its functionality.
- Distributing a product that relies on opensecurity running within a container or as a separate process.

Essentially, if your product relies on opensecurity in any way to work, it is considered "embedded."

## 3. Professional Services & Internal Use

### Is it okay to offer consulting or support services for opensecurity?

Yes, **you** can offer consulting and professional services to help others use opensecurity. This includes assistance with deployment, management, and operation. The BSL only restricts embedding opensecurity into a competing product or offering it as a hosted service that competes with opensecurity's commercial offerings.


### Can I run (or host) opensecurity on my company's internal servers?

Yes, **you** can host opensecurity for internal use within your organization. This includes both production and non-production environments. The restriction on hosting only applies when you offer opensecurity as a service to external parties in a way that competes with opensecurity's commercial offerings.
