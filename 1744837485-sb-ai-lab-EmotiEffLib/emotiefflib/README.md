- Install EmotiEffLib with ONNX support:
   ```sh
   pip install emotiefflib
   ```
- Install EmotiEffLib with ONNX and Torch support:
   ```sh
   pip install emotiefflib[torch]
   ```
- Install EmotiEffLib with ONNX and TensorFlow support (the last one is necessary for enagement prediction):
   ```sh
   pip install emotiefflib[engagement]
   ```
- Install EmotiEffLib with all possible dependencies:
   ```sh
   pip install emotiefflib[all]
   ```
   or
   ```sh
   pip install emotiefflib[torch,engagement]
   ```
