EmotiEffLib (ex-HSEmotion) is a lightweight library for emotion and
engagement recognition in photos and videos. It can be used in Python and C++.
It provides flexibility with backend support for Pytorch and ONNX, enabling
efficient real-time analysis across various platforms.

This repository contains two implementations of EmotiEffLib: [Python](emotiefflib/README.md) and [C++](emotieffcpplib/README.md).

## Documentation

## Usage

Detailed examples of using the Python and C++ modules are provided in the [Tutorials](docs/tutorials/README.md).

If you want to run EmotiEffCppLib then prepare the models for inference with C++ library:
```
python models/prepare_models_for_emotieffcpplib.py
```

Also, in the folder [training_and_examples](training_and_examples/README.md) you can find a number
of examples of usage our models and training process. This folder also contains an example of
[mobile application](training_and_examples/mobile_app) for recognizing user emotions.

In order to run our code on the datasets, please prepare them firstly using our TensorFlow notebooks: [train_emotions.ipynb](training_and_examples/affectnet/train_emotions.ipynb), [AFEW_train.ipynb](training_and_examples/AFEW_train.ipynb) and [VGAF_train.ipynb](training_and_examples/VGAF_train.ipynb).

NOTE!!! The models were updated so that they should work with timm library of version 0.9.*. However, for v0.1 version, please be sure that EfficientNet models for PyTorch are based on old timm 0.4.5 package, so that exactly this version should be installed by the following command:
```
pip install timm==0.4.5
```

## Details
All the models were pre-trained for face identification task using [VGGFace2 dataset](https://github.com/ox-vgg/vgg_face2). In order to train PyTorch models, [SAM code](https://github.com/davda54/sam) was borrowed.

We upload several [models](models/affectnet_emotions) that obtained the state-of-the-art results for [AffectNet dataset](http://mohammadmahoor.com/affectnet/). The facial features extracted by these models lead to the state-of-the-art accuracy of face-only models on video datasets from EmotiW [2019](https://sites.google.com/view/emotiw2019), [2020](https://sites.google.com/view/emotiw2020) challenges: [AFEW (Acted Facial Expression In The Wild)](https://cs.anu.edu.au/few/AFEW.html), [VGAF (Video level Group AFfect)](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8925231),  [EngageWild](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8615851); and ABAW [CVPR 2022](https://ibug.doc.ic.ac.uk/resources/cvpr-2022-3rd-abaw/) and [ECCV 2022](https://ibug.doc.ic.ac.uk/resources/eccv-2023-4th-abaw/) challenges: Learning from Synthetic Data (LSD) and Multi-task Learning (MTL).

Here are the performance metrics (accuracy on AffectNet, AFEW and VGAF), F1-score on LSD, on the validation sets of the above-mentioned datasets and the mean inference time for our models on Samsung Fold 3 device with Qualcomm 888 CPU and Android 12:

Please note, that we report the accuracies for AFEW and VGAF only on the subsets, in which MTCNN detects facial regions. The code contains also computation of overall accuracy on the complete testing set, which is slightly lower due to the absence of faces or failed face detection.
