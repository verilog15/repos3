# of an alias to insert a newline as if a physical newline was in the original
# file. When you need a literal { or } or , in the value part of an alias you
# have to escape them by means of a backslash (\), this can lead to conflicts

# Doxygen selects the parser to use depending on the extension of the files it

# using this tag. The format is ext=language, where ext is a file extension, and
# language is one of the parsers supported by Doxygen: IDL, Java, JavaScript,
# Csharp (C#), C, C++, Lex, D, PHP, md (Markdown), Objective-C, Python, Slice,
# VHDL, Fortran (fixed format Fortran: FortranFixed, free formatted Fortran:
# FortranFree, unknown formatted Fortran: Fortran. In the later case the parser
# tries to guess whether the code is fixed or free formatted code, this is the
# default for Fortran type files). For instance to make Doxygen treat .inc files
# as Fortran files (default is PHP), and .f files as C (default is Fortran),
# use: inc=Fortran f=C.
#
# Note: For files without extension you can use no_extension as a placeholder.

# to work a browser that supports JavaScript, DHTML, CSS and frames is required
# (i.e. any modern browser). Windows users are probably better off using the
# HTML help feature. Via custom style sheets (see HTML_EXTRA_STYLESHEET) one can
# further fine tune the look of the index (see "Fine-tuning the output"). As an
# example, the default style sheet generated by Doxygen has an example that
# shows how to put an image at the root of the tree instead of the PROJECT_NAME.
